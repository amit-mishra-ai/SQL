## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains hospital-level records including:  
- Hospital Name  
- Location (City)  
- Department  
- Number of Doctors  
- Number of Patients  
- Admission & Discharge Dates  
- Medical Expenses

## 🚀 Goals of the Project  
- Analyze patient volume by hospital, department, and city  
- Evaluate doctor-to-patient ratios and average availability  
- Track medical expenses across hospitals and time periods  
- Measure hospital stay durations and department-wise averages  
- Identify top-performing and underperforming departments
